# Project Overview
VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) circuits are becoming increasingly complex with millions of transistors integrated onto a single chip. As circuit size and design complexity grow, manual optimization of VLSI circuits for performance, power consumption, area, and reliability becomes time-consuming and inefficient.

This project focuses on leveraging Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to analyze, detect, and optimize VLSI circuit designs automatically. By integrating ML models with simulation data, the project aims to improve fault detection, power efficiency, delay optimization, and overall circuit reliability.

# 🎯 Objectives
Develop a data-driven approach for VLSI circuit optimization.

Use benchmark circuits (digital and analog) to collect simulation data for ML training.

Detect and classify faults, performance bottlenecks, and design inefficiencies using ML algorithms.

Optimize power consumption, timing delay, and area utilization automatically.

Provide a scalable ML-based framework that can adapt to different VLSI designs.

# ⚡ Key Features
✅ Benchmark Circuit Simulation: Use ISCAS'85 (e.g., C432, C880) and analog circuits for data collection.

✅ Fault Injection: Simulate stuck-at, bridging, and timing errors in circuits.

✅ Data Preprocessing: Extract power, delay, switching activity, and output correctness from Verilog simulations.

✅ ML-Based Fault Detection: Use algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks for error classification.

✅ Optimization: Suggest modifications to logic design or parameters for better performance and reduced energy consumption.

✅ Visualization: Graphs showing fault classification accuracy, delay improvements, and power optimization results.
